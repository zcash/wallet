If the folder path does not exist post-canonicalization, the non-canonicalized
path is used instead to generate the `#ident::get` implementation. The path is
checked as a prefix on requested paths to avoid escapes; not having this be a
known-canonical path could be a problem in some scenarios. This is a limitation
of how `Path::canonicalize` relies on filesystem resolution, and cannot
canonicalize a path that does not exist.

This change was made as part of adding a default-disabled `allow_missing`
attribute, and the generator is gated on a check that the non-canonicalized path
exists (if the new attribute is off), so there should not be any changes to
existing usage.
