# Zallet wallet

Zallet is a full-node Zcash wallet written in Rust. It is being built as a replacement for
the [`zcashd`](https://github.com/zcash/zcash) wallet.

## Security Warnings

These crates are under development and have not been fully reviewed.

Zallet is not designed to be used as a Rust library; we give no guarantees about
any such usage.

## Current phase: Alpha release

Zallet is currently in alpha. What this means is:

- Breaking changes may occur at any time, requiring you to delete and recreate your Zallet
  wallet.
- Many JSON-RPC methods that will be ported from `zcashd` have not yet been implemented.
- We will be rapidly making changes as we release new alpha versions.

We encourage everyone to test out Zallet during the alpha period and provide feedback,
either by [opening issues on GitHub](https://github.com/zcash/wallet/issues/new) or
contacting us in the `#wallet-dev` channel of the
[Zcash R&D Discord](https://discord.gg/xpzPR53xtU).

## Usage

See the [user guide](https://zcash.github.io/wallet/) for information on how to set up a Zallet wallet.

## Reproducible Builds

Zallet leverages [StageX](https://codeberg.org/stagex/stagex/) to provied a 
full source bootstrapped, and deterministic/reproducible build and runtime 
dependencies. This helps mitigate supply chain attacks, and especially trusting 
trust style attacks and reduces trust in any single computer or individual.

### Requirements
* Docker 25+
* [`containerd` support](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/containerd/#enable-containerd-image-store-on-docker-engine)
* GNU Make

### Usage

* To `build` and `import` the image use the `make` command

* The `build` commmands uses the `utils/compat.sh` and `utils/builds.sh`
in order to ensure that the user has required dependencies installed and that
the [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) image built is deterministic by using
the appropriate flags.

### Details

* `stagex/core-user-runtime` is used to set user to non-root and provide a 
minimal filesystem
