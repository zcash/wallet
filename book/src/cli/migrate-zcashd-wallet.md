# The `migrate-zcashd-wallet` command

> Available on **crate feature** `zcashd-import` only.

`zallet migrate-zcashd-wallet` migrates a `zcashd` wallet file (`wallet.dat`) to a Zallet
wallet (`wallet.db`).

[`zallet init-wallet-encryption`] must be run before this command.

Parsing a `zcashd` wallet file requires the `db_dump` utility built for Berkeley DB
version 6.2 (the version `zcashd` uses). When Zallet is built with the `zcashd-import`
feature it compiles and uses a vendored copy of this utility automatically, so you
normally do not need to provide one yourself. If that vendored utility is unavailable,
Zallet falls back to a `db_dump` found on the system `$PATH`; you can also point Zallet
at a specific `zcashd` installation's `db_dump` with `--zcashd-install-dir` (see below).

The command requires at least one of the following two flag:

- `--path`: A path to a `zcashd` wallet file.
- `--zcashd-datadir`: A path to a `zcashd` datadir. If this is provided, then `--path` can
  be relative (or omitted, in which case the default filename `wallet.dat` will be used).

Additional CLI arguments:
- `--zcashd-install-dir`: A path to a local `zcashd` installation directory, for
  source-based builds of `zcashd`. When set, Zallet uses the `db_dump` from that
  installation's `zcutil/bin` directory instead of its vendored copy. This is rarely
  needed, and generally not recommended: the vendored `db_dump` is built for the
  Berkeley DB version (6.2) that `zcashd` wallets use, so prefer it unless you have a
  specific reason to use your `zcashd` installation's utility (for example, a wallet
  written by a non-standard Berkeley DB build). If neither this flag nor the vendored
  `db_dump` is available, Zallet falls back to a `db_dump` on the system `$PATH`.
- `--allow-multiple-wallet-imports`: An optional flag that must be set if a
  user wants to import keys and transactions from multiple `wallet.dat` files
  (not required for the first `wallet.dat` import.)
- `--buffer-wallet-transactions`: If set, Zallet will eagerly fetch transaction
  data from the chain as part of wallet migration instead of via ordinary chain
  sync. This may speed up wallet recovery, but requires all wallet transactions
  to be buffered in-memory which may cause out-of-memory errors for large
  wallets.
- `--allow-warnings`: If set, Zallet will ignore errors in parsing transactions
  extracted from the `wallet.dat` file. This can enable the import of key data
  from wallets that have been used on consensus forks of the Zcash chain.

> For the Zallet alpha releases, the command also currently takes another required flag
> `--this-is-alpha-code-and-you-will-need-to-redo-the-migration-later`.

When run, Zallet will parse the `zcashd` wallet file, connect to the backing
full node (to obtain necessary chain information for setting up wallet
birthdays), create Zallet accounts corresponding to the structure of the
`zcashd` wallet, and store the key material in the Zallet wallet. Parsing is
performed using the `db_dump` command-line utility. By default Zallet uses the
copy it vendors and builds, which is the recommended choice; a `zcashd`-provided
`db_dump` from the `zcutil/bin` directory of a source installation (via
`--zcashd-install-dir`), or one on the system `$PATH`, are used otherwise.
