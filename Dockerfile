# Standard, multi-arch Zallet image — the everyday `docker build` path.
#
# This is the DEFAULT Dockerfile: a plain, widely-understood multi-stage build
# on official images that works out of the box on linux/amd64 AND linux/arm64
# (incl. Apple Silicon) via `docker build` / `docker buildx`. It uses Docker's
# native $TARGETARCH so a single `docker buildx build --platform
# linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .` produces both.
#
#   docker build -t zallet .
#   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t zallet .
#
# It is also REPRODUCIBLE (rebuild-deterministic): bases are digest-pinned,
# timestamps come from SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, build paths are remapped out of the
# binary, and the apt/ldconfig caches (which embed wall-clock times) are dropped.
# Two builds of the same commit + same base digests produce the same bytes.
# Build reproducibly with:
#   docker buildx build --build-arg SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git log -1 --pretty=%ct) \
#     --output type=image,rewrite-timestamp=true .
#
# This does NOT bootstrap its toolchain (it pins a prebuilt rust + debian, like
# most reproducible-build setups). The full-source-bootstrapped release path is
# `Dockerfile.stagex` (amd64); `flake.nix` gives a bit-for-bit static-musl build
# for both arches. See book/src/slsa/slsa.md.

# --- Stage 1: build ---------------------------------------------------------
# Digest-pin the base so the build is a function of its inputs only (bump the
# tag AND the digest together, deliberately). rust 1.91.1 on bookworm matches
# the runtime base below so the dynamically-linked glibc binary just works.

# `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`) that isn't installed, and the *-sys crates
# (secp256k1-sys, etc.) fail with "failed to find tool ...-gcc". A plain
# `cargo build` uses the in-image gcc/clang for the native arch and Just Works
