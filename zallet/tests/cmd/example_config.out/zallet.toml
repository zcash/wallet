# Default configuration for Zallet.
#
# This file is generated as an example using Zallet's current defaults. It can
# be used as a skeleton for custom configs.
#
# Fields that are required to be set are uncommented, and set to an example
# value. Every other field is commented out, and set to the current default
# value that Zallet will use for it (or `UNSET` if the field has no default).
#
# Leaving a field commented out means that Zallet will always use the latest
# default value, even if it changes in future. Uncommenting a field but keeping
# it set to the current default value means that Zallet will treat it as a
# user-configured value going forward.

#
# This setting is a trade-off between latency and security: a smaller value makes

# Enable "legacy `zcashd` pool of funds" semantics for the given seed.
#
# The seed fingerprint should correspond to the mnemonic phrase of a `zcashd` wallet
# imported into this Zallet wallet.
#
# # Background
#
# `zcashd` had two kinds of legacy balance semantics:
# - The transparent JSON-RPC methods inherited from Bitcoin Core treated all
#   spendable funds in the wallet as being part of a single pool of funds. RPCs like
#   `sendmany` didn't allow the caller to specify which transparent addresses to
#   spend funds from, and RPCs like `getbalance` similarly computed a balance across
#   all transparent addresses returned from `getaddress`.
# - The early shielded JSON-RPC methods added for Sprout treated every address as a
#   separate pool of funds, because for Sprout there was a 1:1 relationship between
#   addresses and spend authority. RPCs like `z_sendmany` only spent funds that were
#   sent to the specified addressed, and RPCs like `z_getbalance` similarly computed
#   a separate balance for each address (which became complex and unintuitive with
#   the introduction of Sapling diversified addresses).
#
# With the advent of Unified Addresses and HD-derived spending keys, `zcashd` gained
# its modern balance semantics: each full viewing key in the wallet is a separate
# pool of funds, and treated as a separate "account". These are the semantics used
# throughout Zallet, and that should be used by everyone going forward. They are
# also incompatible with various legacy JSON-RPC methods that were deprecated in
# `zcashd`, as well as some fields of general RPC methods; these methods and fields
# are unavailable in Zallet by default.
#
# However, given that `zcashd` wallets can be imported into Zallet, and in order to
# ease the transition between them, this setting turns on legacy balance semantics
# in Zallet:
# - JSON-RPC methods that only work with legacy semantics become available for use.
# - Fields in responses that are calculated using legacy semantics are included.
#
# Due to how the legacy transparent semantics in particular were defined by Bitcoin
# Core, this can only be done for a single `zcashd` wallet at a time. Given that
# every `zcashd` wallet in production in 2025 had a single mnemonic seed phrase in
# its wallet, we use its ZIP 32 seed fingerprint as the `zcashd` wallet identifier
# in this setting.
