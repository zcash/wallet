    # From the bash-completion FAQ (https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/blob/master/README.md#faq):
    # > Q. I author/maintain package X and would like to maintain my own completion code
    # >    for this package. Where should I put it to be sure that interactive bash shells
    # >    will find it and source it?
    # > A. Install it in one of the directories pointed to by bash-completion's `pkgconfig`
    # >    file variables. [..] The recommended directory is `completionsdir`, which you
    # >    can get with `pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion`.
    #
    # On Ubuntu 22.04 this resolves to `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions`.

    # > Completion files can be installed like other modules into a global module search

    # > user would have to import them manually with `use`.

    # > 3. If the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable is defined and non-empty, it is
    # >    treated as a colon-delimited list of paths (semicolon-delimited on Windows),
    # >    which are all searched.
    # >
    # >    Otherwise, `/usr/local/share/elvish/lib` and `/usr/share/elvish/lib` are
    # >    searched on non-Windows OSes.

    # >   their software, usually `/usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d`;
    # > [..]
    # > If you are developing another program and would like to ship completions with your
    # > program, install them to the “vendor” completions directory. As this path may vary
    # > from system to system, the `pkgconfig` framework should be used to discover this
