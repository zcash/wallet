//! The Zallet sync engine.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Zallet uses `zcash_client_sqlite` for its wallet, which stores its own view of the
//! chain. The goal of this engine is to keep the wallet's chain view as closely synced to
//! the network's chain as possible. This means handling environmental events such as:
//!
//! - A new block being mined.
//! - A reorg to a different chain.
//! - A transaction being added to the mempool.
//! - A new viewing capability being added to the wallet.
//! - The wallet starting up after being offline for some time.
//!
//! To handle this, we split the chain into two "regions of responsibility":
//!
//! - The [`steady_state`] task handles the region of the chain within 100 blocks of the
//!   network chain tip (corresponding to Zebra's "non-finalized state"). This task is
//!   started once when Zallet starts, and any error will cause Zallet to shut down.
//! - The [`recover_history`] task handles the region of the chain farther than 100 blocks
//!   from the network chain tip (corresponding to Zebra's "finalized state"). This task
//!   is active whenever there are unscanned blocks in this region.
//!
//! Note the boundary between these regions may be less than 100 blocks from the network
//! chain tip at times, due to how reorgs are implemented in Zebra; the boundary ratchets
//! forward as the chain tip height increases, but never backwards.
//!
//! TODO: Integrate or remove these other notes:
//!
//! - Zebra discards the non-finalized chain tip on restart, so Zallet needs to tolerate
//!   the `ChainView` being up to 100 blocks behind the wallet's view of the chain tip at
//!   process start.
