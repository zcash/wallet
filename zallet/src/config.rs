    ///
    /// # Background
    ///
    /// `zcashd` had two kinds of legacy balance semantics:
    /// - The transparent JSON-RPC methods inherited from Bitcoin Core treated all
    ///   spendable funds in the wallet as being part of a single pool of funds. RPCs like
    ///   `sendmany` didn't allow the caller to specify which transparent addresses to
    ///   spend funds from, and RPCs like `getbalance` similarly computed a balance across
    ///   all transparent addresses returned from `getaddress`.
    /// - The early shielded JSON-RPC methods added for Sprout treated every address as a
    ///   separate pool of funds, because for Sprout there was a 1:1 relationship between
    ///   addresses and spend authority. RPCs like `z_sendmany` only spent funds that were
    ///   sent to the specified addressed, and RPCs like `z_getbalance` similarly computed
    ///   a separate balance for each address (which became complex and unintuitive with
    ///   the introduction of Sapling diversified addresses).
    ///
    /// With the advent of Unified Addresses and HD-derived spending keys, `zcashd` gained
    /// its modern balance semantics: each full viewing key in the wallet is a separate
    /// pool of funds, and treated as a separate "account". These are the semantics used
    /// throughout Zallet, and that should be used by everyone going forward. They are
    /// also incompatible with various legacy JSON-RPC methods that were deprecated in
    /// `zcashd`, as well as some fields of general RPC methods; these methods and fields
    /// are unavailable in Zallet by default.
    ///
    /// However, given that `zcashd` wallets can be imported into Zallet, and in order to
    /// ease the transition between them, this setting turns on legacy balance semantics
    /// in Zallet:
    /// - JSON-RPC methods that only work with legacy semantics become available for use.
    /// - Fields in responses that are calculated using legacy semantics are included.
    ///
    /// Due to how the legacy transparent semantics in particular were defined by Bitcoin
    /// Core, this can only be done for a single `zcashd` wallet at a time. Given that
    /// every `zcashd` wallet in production in 2025 had a single mnemonic seed phrase in
    /// its wallet, we use its ZIP 32 seed fingerprint as the `zcashd` wallet identifier
